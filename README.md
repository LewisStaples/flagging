# Flagging Website

![](flagging_site/static/images/og_preview.png)

**Our website is live at: [https://crwa-flagging.herokuapp.com/](https://crwa-flagging.herokuapp.com/)**

## Overview

This is the code base for the [Charles River Watershed Association's](https://crwa.org/) ("CRWA") flagging website. The flagging website hosts an interface for the CRWA's staff to monitor the outputs of a predictive model that determines whether it is reasonably safe to swim or boat in the Charles River.

This code base is built in Python 3.7+ and utilizes the Flask library heavily. The website can be run locally in development mode, and it can be deployed to Heroku using Gunicorn.

## For Developers and Maintainers
