    <h2>Public Flagging API</h2>
    <p>
        Pursuant to CRWA's mission to provide open access to ecological data to the greater Boston community and the
        world, the CRWA allows open access to its Public Flagging API, which provides JSON versions of the CRWA's data
        utilized in modeling, the CRWA's model outputs, and relevant metadata.
    </p>
    <p>
        The API is built on simple REST principles; user of the Public Flagging API can utilize GET requests to retrieve
        the data. Additional APIs may be added to the project as development progresses. This is a volunteer
        driven project and we appreciate developers' and researchers' input on what would be most useful.
