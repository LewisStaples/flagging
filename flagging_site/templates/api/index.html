    <h2>Flagging Program</h2>
    <p>
        The CRWA's API endpoints return JSON metadata based on REST principles about water quality, temperature, precipitation, and wind speed
        from sensors located in the Charles River. The current API for the project utilizes a single HTTP request-response
        mechanism, the GET request, to retrieve data. Users of the CRWA Public API can use GET requests to fetch data
        for further analysis. Additional APIs may be added to the project as development progresses. This is a volunteer
        driven project and we appreciate developer input on what would be most useful.

        <br><br><br><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/model">Access to the API is free and open to the public.</a>

        <br><br><br><strong>Note: The v1 API is still tentative and under development at this time. It will be
        finalized when this messsage is removed.</strong>
