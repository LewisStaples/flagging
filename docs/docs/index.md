Welcome to the CRWA Flagging Website Documentation!

This site provides developers and maintainers information about the CRWA's flagging website, including information on: deploying the website, developing the website, using the website's code locally, and using the website's admin panel.

## For Website Administrators

If the website is already deployed and you want to implement a manual override, you do not need to follow the setup guide. All you need to do is read the [admin](../admin) guide to manage the website while it's deployed.

## Connecting to Weebly

Work in progress

## For Developers

Start by following the [setup guide](../setup). Once you have the website setup locally, you now have access to the following:

- Deploy the website to Heroku (guide [here](../deployment))
- Manually run commands and download data through the [shell](../shell).
- Make changes to the predictive model, including revising its coefficients. (Guide is currently WIP)
- (Advanced) Make other changes to the website.
