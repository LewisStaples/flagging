# Overview

The flagging website is designed to be hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/). The guide for how to set up deployment is available [here](../cloud/heroku_deployment.md).

The full cloud deployment depends not only on Heroku but also Twitter's development API. The Twitter bot only needs to be set up once and, notwithstanding exigent circumstances (losing the API key, migrating the bot, or handling a Twitter ban), the Twitter bot does not need any additional maintenance. Nevertheless, there is documentation for how to set up the Twitter bot [here](../cloud/twitter_bot.md).
