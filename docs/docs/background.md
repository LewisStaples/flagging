# Background 
# Charles River


Throughout most of the 20th century, the Charles River in Boston was known for its contaminated water. The reputation of the Charles River was popularized out of state by the song [Dirty Water by the Standells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Water), which peaked at #11 on the Billboard singles chart on June 11, 1965. (The song has a chorus containing the lines "Well I love that dirty water / Boston you're my home.")

Starting in the late 80s, efforts were made to start cleaning up the Charles River. In 1988, as the result of a lawsuit from the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) created a combined sewer overflow system to address sewage in the Charles River. In 1995, the CRWA, EPA, municipalities, and Massachusetts state agencies launched the Clean Charles Initiative, which included a report card for the Charles River that is issued by EPA scientists annually. The first grade the Charles River received was a D for the year 1995. The Charles River's grade [peaked](https://www.wbur.org/earthwhile/2019/06/12/charles-river-water-quality-report-card-2018) at A- in 2013 and 2018.

## Charles River Watershed Association

The Charles River Watershed Association ("CRWA") was formed in 1965, the same year that Dirty Water peaked at #11 on the Billboard singles chart. [Via the CRWA's website:](https://www.crwa.org/about.html)

> CRWA is one of the countryâ€™s oldest watershed organizations and has figured prominently in major cleanup and protection efforts. Since our earliest days of advocacy, we have worked with government officials and citizen groups from 35 Massachusetts watershed towns from Hopkinton to Boston.

The EPA also relies on sample data collected by the CRWA to construct its report card.

## Flagging Program

Of the many services that the CRWA provides to the greater Boston community, one of those is monitoring whether it is safe to swim and/or boat in the Charles River. 

## Code for Boston

Code for Boston is a volunteer Civic Technology meetup. We are part of the Code for America Brigade network, and are made up of developers, designers, data geeks, citizen activists, and many others who use creative technology to solve civic and social problems. We aim to find creative means of technology to help better the lives of individuals in our communities. We meet every Tuesday
